     *   This is what the user should see after a fresh install of the app
     *   Clicking the + button in the navigation bar should take you to page 3
     *   Reschedule and cancel should not do anything when clicked
 
  *   Page 3-5
     *   The pictures behind should scroll right or left infinitely
     *   The page control should always reflect the appropriate page
     *   The reserve button should only work for the Hot Stone massage picture

     *   The current Month should be displayed and the user should be able to scroll through all the days of the month
     *   Times from 9 am to 8 pm should be shown and scrollable
     *   The reserve button should be faded and disabled until a day and time are selected
 
*   Page 7
     *   Once a day or time is tapped, a view with a checkmark should show to indicate what has been selected

     *   After the reserve button is tapped, the user should be taken to the My Reservations screen
     *   On this screen, the user should see all reservations
